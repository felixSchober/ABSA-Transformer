I would like to thank all the people that helped and contributed to this thesis. I want to express my gratitude to Gerhard Hagerer and Georg Groh. 
\medskip

They gave me the opportunity to work on this amazing topic and write my master's thesis. The weekly meetings gave me the motivation, feedback and advice needed to complete this thesis. 
\medskip

It is not common to have advisors who invest this much energy, time and passion to help their students. I could always schedule a meeting with my advisor and we would discuss interesting topics together. Thanks a lot for this great time.
\medskip

I would also like to thank my family, close friends and my girlfriend. They understood when I did not have time for them. However, for some reason they still supported me regardless at all times with advice and freshly cooked meals when I did not have time to cook.
