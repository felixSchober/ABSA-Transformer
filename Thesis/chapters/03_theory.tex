\section{Word Representations}

While it is trivial to use images as input for machine learning techniques the same can not be said for language. Images already come in matrix form while words appear as discrete objects. Before language can be used for machine learning, words have to be transformed into a matrix first. A function $W(\text{word}) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \quad \text{word} \in V$  which encodes words from a vocabulary $V$ into a $n$-dimensional matrix is called a word embedding.
\medskip

The easiest way to achieve this is a one-hot encoding of a vocabulary. We just take the vocabulary which is a list of $N$ words and number the words sequentially. A word vector is created by getting the index of the word from the vocabulary and setting the value of the word vector at the word-index to one and all other entries to zero.

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		W(\text{"dog"}) = [1, 0, 0] \\
		W(\text{"cat"}) = [0, 1, 0] \\
		W(\text{"bee"}) = [0, 0, 1] \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}


While this works for small vocabulary sizes, with larger vocabularies one will encounter problems. When having a vocabulary size of $N=10,000$ this approach will produce $10,000$-dimensional vectors for each word. What makes matters even worse is that those vectors are extremely sparse since they only have one non-zero entry.
\medskip

\subsection{Vector Space}
\label{sec:03_vectorSpace}

In 1992 Schütze {(and to some extend Hinton in 1986 \cite{Hinton1986})} pioneered the idea of an universal word vector space \cite{Schutze1992}. The general idea is that instead of having sparse, high dimensional word encodings it would be better to have low-dimensional, dense word vectors where semantically similar words appear close together in the continuos word vector space. Unrelated words should be far away from each other. For example, the distance between the words "dog" and "cat" should be low while the distance between "bed" and "rocket" should be high. Figure \ref{fig:03_WordEmbeddings} shows a visualization of a word vector space which has been reduced by t-SNE to two dimensions.
\medskip

To achieve this, Schütze suggested to count co-occurrence of words and their neighbors and construct a co-occurrence matrix \cite{Schutze1992}. While this makes the word-matrix dense {(only 2\% of the entries are zero)} the resulting matrix is still extremely large. To get more useful vectors dimensionality reduction techniques like \gls{lsa} have to be applied.
\medskip

Of course, this task can also be solved by neural networks. Imagine $W$ to be a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times n}$ where each row corresponds to a word and $n$ is the dimension of the desired word vector equivalent to a lookup table. We initialize the weights of $W$ randomly and use $W$ to transform words into dense vectors so that they look something like this:

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
		W(\text{"dog"}) = [0.3, -0.8, 0.1, \dots] \\
		W(\text{"cat"}) = [-0.1, 0.0, 0.2, \dots] \\
		W(\text{"bee"}) = [0.3, 0.6, -0.9, \dots] \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Instead of improving $W$ directly, we use $W$ to train a network on an auxiliary task like predicting the next word in a sequence. Instead of training $W$ supervised we use an unsupervised task and train $W$ indirectly. This is the basic principle how many modern word embeddings are trained and interestingly, this produces fascinating results shown in figure \ref{fig:03_WordEmbeddings}.
\medskip

Word vectors even allow for basic vector arithmetic. $W(\text{"King"})-W(\text{"Man"})+W(\text{"Woman"})=W(\text{"Queen"})$ is a famous example for this demonstrated by Mikolov et. al. \cite{Mikolov2013d}.

For many \gls{nlp} tasks, word representations have become indispensable and one of the factors of success for many systems \cite{Luong2013}. The next sections will showcase a few of the most popular embedding techniques.

\subsection{Word2Vec}
\label{sec:03_word2vec}

Word2Vec by Mikolov et. al. is a very popular method which learns to produce word embeddings unsupervised from raw text \cite{Mikolov2013}. The authors propose two approaches to learn an embedding. Both are very similar and rely on shallow neural networks to generate good embeddings. Moreover, these methods are computationally much more efficient than previous architectures without sacrificing performance. This allows word2vec to be applied on much bigger corpora with billions of words which was not possible before \cite{Mikolov2013c}.


\subsubsection*{Skip-gram Model}

The training objective for the skip-gram model is to predict the neighborhood context of a given word. For example, given the word $w_t$ and a window size of 2 the objective is to predict the two words before $w_t$ {($w_{t-2}, w_{t-1}$)} as well as the two words after $w_t$ {($w_{t+1}, w_{t+2}$)}. The objective can be formalized as maximizing the average log probability \cite{Mikolov2013e}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \quad \sum_{-c\leq j \leq c, j \neq 0} log p(w_{t+j} | w_t)
\end{equation}

$T$ is the number of words in the corpus, $c$ is the context window size and $p(w_{t+j} | w_t)$ is the softmax function. Simply put, skip-gram predicts a context given a source word.

\subsubsection*{\acrfull{cbow}}

\gls{cbow} is very similar to the skip-gram model. However, instead of predicting context words for a source word, \gls{cbow} predicts the next word $w_{t}$ in a sequence, given the previous words $w_{t-j}$ \cite{Mikolov2013c}. In some instances the surrounding words are taken as the context instead of just the previous words. In other words, the objective of \gls{cbow} is to predict a word given it's context.
\medskip

Skip-gram works better for smaller datasets than \gls{cbow} since it is possible to generate more training pairs from a sequence. In addition, it is also able to represent rare words better than \gls{cbow}. However, \gls{cbow} is faster to train than skip-gram and yields slightly better accuracy for more frequent words.

\subsection{\acrfull{glove}}

There are two methods for create word vectors: word co-occurrence counting {(section \ref{sec:03_vectorSpace})} and the window based skip-gram / \gls{cbow} methods {(section \ref{sec:03_word2vec})}. Co-occurrence is relatively fast and efficient to collect and train unless the vocabulary is very big. A co-occurrence matrix also captures a lot of global statistical information whereas local window based models only capture the statistics for the window. However, most of the information a co-occurrence matrix provides is about the word similarity and not necessarily about the semantics. In addition, frequent words like "the" or "a" co-occur with a lot of other words. Therefore, they have huge co-occurrence counts with many words without providing any useful information \cite{Pennington2014a}.

Local window based models like word2vec have the disadvantage that training is not as efficient and a lot of statistical information is not captured \cite{Pennington2014a}. 
\medskip

\gls{glove} which was introduced by Pennington et. al. tries to combine the advantages of both model families \cite{Pennington2014a}. \gls{glove} captures the global corpus statistics directly by creating a co-occurence matrix $X$ where the entry $X_{ij}$ denotes how often the word $j$ occurs together with $i$. The probability that $i$ appears in the context of $j$ is 

\begin{equation}
	P_{ij}=P(j|i)=\frac{X_{ij}}{X_i}=\frac{X_{ij}}{\sum_k X_{ik}}\quad.
\end{equation}

To put it simply, $P_{ij}$ is just the number of times $i$ and $j$ appeared together divided by the sum of all words that $i$ appeared with \cite{Pennington2014a}.

Pennington et. al. demonstrate that the ratio of probabilities $P_{ik} / P_{jk}$  encodes a lot of the meaning that is lost in traditional co-occurence based methods \cite{Pennington2014a}.
\medskip

The authors use $F$ to describe this ratio as

\begin{equation}
	F(w_i, w_j, \widetilde{w}_k) \approx \frac{P_{ik}}{P_{jk}}
\end{equation}

$w$ are just word vectors of $i$, $j$ and $k$ {($\widetilde{w}$)} is a context vector. In the end the goal is to get a good candidate for $F$ that fulfills all our requirements. By adding vector differences {($w_i - w_j$)} and linear relations {(dot-product)} $F$ becomes

\begin{equation}
	F((w_i - w_j)^T \cdot \widetilde{w}_k) \approx \frac{P_{ik}}{P_{jk}} \quad .
\end{equation}

By replacing the probability ratio with logarithms we arrive at

\begin{equation}
	w_i^T \cdot \widetilde{w}_k = log(P_{ik}) = log(X_{ik}) - log(X_i) \quad .
\end{equation}

The weighted least squares objective function is then finally

\begin{equation}
	J = \sum_{i,j=1}^V f(X_{ij}) (w_i^T \cdot \widetilde{w}_k + b_i+\widetilde{b}_j - log(X_{ij})^2)
\end{equation}

where $V$ is the vocabulary size and $b$ and $\widetilde{b}$ are bias terms that are added.
\medskip

The last problem is solved by a weighting function $f(X_{ij})$. Co-occurences which are infrequent will contain a lot of noise. Therefore it is important to reduce the influence of noisy words and prevent frequent words like "the" from dominating the model. Therefore, they weight each word to make sure that words are not over or underrepresented.

\subsection{FastText}

FastText is an embedding technique which focuses on efficiency but is still on par with other word embedding techniques \cite{Joulin2016}.
\medskip

FastText is based on Word2Vec. However, whereas word2vec treats each word as an atomic entity, FastText splits words into several character n-grams. The word "where" consists of the following 5 $n$-grams for $n=3$ \cite{Bojanowski2017}: 

\begin{center}
	"\verb|<wh|", "\verb|whe|", "\verb|her|", "\verb|ere|", "\verb|re>|"
\end{center}

The special characters "<" and ">" are boundary symbols to differentiate prefixes and suffixes from the beginning and ending of words \cite{Bojanowski2017}.
\medskip

This notion is very powerful since it provides several advantages over previous models. For one, out of vocabulary words are better recognized since their $n$-grams are still known. Unknown words can therefore be partly constructed by known $n$-grams. \cite{Bojanowski2017}. 
\medskip

Some languages like German which heavily rely on compound words also profit from this technique since those words can also be constructed using known $n$-grams \cite{Bojanowski2017}.
\medskip

Lastly, FastText represents rare words a lot better than word2vec. Even if a word is very rare and only occurs in a sentence a few times in total, there is a high chance that the model consists of $n$-grams which appear in other, more frequent words \cite{Bojanowski2017}.

\section{Google Transformer Architecture}

The Google transformer architecture is a novel neural network architecture for automatic machine translation tasks by Vaswani et. al. \cite{Vaswani2017d}. Instead of relying on \gls{rnn} based architectures with recurrence, the transformer uses an attention mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art results on machine translation tasks. Like most of sequence-to-sequence models the transformer also uses the encoder-decoder pattern to translate a sentence from the source to the target language. We will mostly focus on the encoder part of the model since this is the part, we use to perform \gls{absa} classification.
\medskip

The issue when training many \gls{rnn}-based architectures is the problem of long-range dependencies. These dependencies may lead to either vanishing or exploding gradient \cite{Hochreiter2009}. The dilemma is, that language translations features a lot of long dependencies. For some translations like "I like planes" to "Ich mag Flugzeuge" each token exactly matches the position of the translation. However, in many cases the positioning of words is different. Take the sentence "I think I \underline{saw} you at the airport \emph{yesterday}". This would translate to "Ich glaube, dass ich dich \emph{gestern} im Flughafen \underline{gesehen habe}".

When translating this sentence from English to German, a recurrent architecture has to keep the dependency of "\underline{saw}" of all the way until the end of the German sentence when it has to output the tokens "\underline{gesehen habe}".
\medskip

Besides the issue with long-term dependencies, \gls{rnn} architectures are also almost impossible to parallelize which is especially important for long sequences \cite{Vaswani2017d}.
\medskip

The transformer model tries to fix both problems. It is the first transduction model to completely gives up on recurrence or convolutions to compute sequence representations \cite{Vaswani2017d}. 

Instead it relies on attention and specifically multi-head attention. Attention allows a model to focus on relevant information and the idea of multi-head attentions enables parallelization as well as attention heads which focus on their attention on different aspects \cite{Vaswani2017d}.

\subsection{Encoder-Decoder Architecture}

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/03_theory/03_transformer_Architecture_HighLevel}
	\caption{High-level overview of the transformer Encoder-Decoder architecture, translating the sentence "I mag Flugzeuge" from German to English. The model is at the step where it translates the last word "Flugzeug" to plane.}
	\label{fig:03_transformer_HighlevelOverview}
\end{figure}

A high level architecture overview of the transformer is depicted in figure \ref{fig:03_transformer_HighlevelOverview}. As already mentioned the transformer resembles an encoder-decoder architecture. Yet, in contrast to traditional encoder-decoders, the transformer consists of $n$ encoder- and $n$ decoder blocks. 
\medskip

The encoder blocks always get the whole input sequence encoded as word vectors. This sequence is then propagated until it reaches the top encoder. From there, the encoder output is passed to all decoder blocks. Furthermore, the decoder blocks also receive the output of the decoder blocks below them. In addition, the first decoder block {(in figure \ref{fig:03_transformer_HighlevelOverview} this block is named "Decoder 1")} receives the sequence of tokens the transformer already predicted. 
\medskip

Following the example in figure \ref{fig:03_transformer_HighlevelOverview} the translation would start by passing the sentence "Ich mag Flugzeuge" through all encoder blocks until it reaches the top block. All 1 to $n$ decoder blocks receive the encoded sentence. The encoded sentence then flows up from the bottom to the top where it outputs the first token "I". 

Decoder 1 now gets two inputs: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item the encoded source sentence it previously also received
	\item the previous predicted output which is the token "I"
\end{enumerate}

Decoder 2 to $n$ now get the encoded input {(as before)} as well as the output of the decoders below. The top encoder will then output "like" as the next token in the sequence. 

The step that would follow this one is shown in figure \ref{fig:03_transformer_HighlevelOverview} where "I like" is already predicted and only the last token is missing.
\bigskip

Figure \ref{fig:03_transformer_overview} shows a detailed overview of one encoder and one decoder block. This is useful to comprehend the information flow on the decoder side.

	\label{fig:03_transformer_overview}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Attention Mechanism}

The transformer uses attention to focus on the important and relevant information in a sequence. The question what is regarded as important is learned.

The specific attention mechanism, the transformer uses is called "Scaled Dot-Product Attention". The input for the attention function are three matrices called "Queries" $Q'$, "Keys" $K'$ and "Values" $V'$. We get these matrices from the input embeddings. We just multiply the embeddings with $W^Q$, $W^K$ and $W^V$. These projection matrices are learned and project our input to a lower dimension so that we get $Q', K', V'$.
\bigskip

We then take the dot-product of $Q'$ and $K'$ and scale the result by dividing by the square root of $d_k$ where $d_k$ is the dimension of $Q'$ and $K'$. Next, we can finally apply the attention. From the softmax we get a vector of probabilities which are the attention values. When we apply the dot product on those attentions and the values we scale the values with the attentions. 
\medskip

Words which are deemed important by the attention mechanism are multiplied with values near 1 while unimportant words are multiplied with small values and therefore become unimportant for the next layers.
\medskip

One aspect which was not mentioned is the "mask"-step. After the scaling operation we set some values to 0. This is done because every input sequence needs to have the same length which we achieve by adding <pad> tokens to sentences which are not long enough. Those tokens carry no information so we can safly discard them in this step. 

In the decoder part we need to mask specific parts of the sentence which the transformer has not predicted yet. This is done to prevent the model from cheating by just replaying the input sequence.
\begin{align}
	\text{Attention}(Q', K', V') & = \text{softmax}(\frac{Q \cdot K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}) \cdot V \\
	\text{AttentionHead}_i(Q, K, V) & = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
\end{align}

\section{Multi-Task Learning}

Rich Caruana first introduced \acrfull{mtl} in 1993. Conventional machine learning approaches break a problem down in smaller tasks and solve one task at a time (e.g., word-by-word \gls{pos}-tagging \cite{Toutanova2007}, word-by-word \gls{ner} \cite{Sang2003} or handwritten image classification \cite{LeCun;1990}). In each of these tasks a classification algorithm solves exactly one task (Assigning a 'part-of-speech' or entity type to a word, or the classification of handwritten digits). Caruana shows that combining multiple related tasks improves model performance \cite{Caruana1993}\cite{Caruana1997a}. 

In \gls{mtl}, multiple related tasks are learned in parallel and share a common representation. Generally speaking every machine learning model which optimizes multiple objectives for a single sample can be considered as Multitask Learning. This includes multi-label classification where one sample can have multiple labels as well as instances where different sample distributions or datasets are used for different tasks.

\gls{mtl} is similar to how humans learn. Generally, humans learn new tasks by applying knowledge from previous experiences and activities. For instance, it is easier to learn ice skating when someone previously learned inline skating. This is because all the underlying important aspects of the tasks are very similar.

When tasks are related this also holds true for machine learning. When learning these tasks in parallel model performance is improved compared to learning them individually since the additional knowledge that a related task carries, can be used to improve on the original task \cite{Caruana1997a}. 

There are four important aspects one can use to determine if \gls{mtl} can bring performance boosts for a specific objective:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Multi Label Task: Multi Label classification task where one sample can have more than one label are almost always inherintly solved using \gls{mtl} if labels are predicted by one model. Multiple authors show that adding tasks always improves performance compared to a separate model for each task as an alternative \cite{Ramsundar2015}. %TODO: More citations
	\item Shared low-level features: \gls{mtl} only makes sense if the tasks share low level features. For instance, image classification and \gls{nlp} do not share common features. In this case the model would not benefit from \gls{mtl} because one task can not help to improve the other task. Therefore, it is important to choose tasks that are related to each other \cite{Zhang2017a}. In most cases \gls{mtl} will work with \gls{nlp} tasks because they usually share at least some kind of sentence or word embedding as a common layer.   % citation to do
	\item Task Data Amount: Several authors have suggested that it is important for the success of \gls{mtl} training that the amount of data for the tasks is similar. Otherwise the model will mainly optimize for the task with most training samples.
	\item Model Size: Finally, the multi-task model needs to have enough parameters to support all tasks \cite{Caruana1997a}. 
	\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Differentiation against Transfer Learning}

Training samples from one task can help improve the other task and vice versa. This is important for the differentiation against transfer learning \cite{Pratt1993}. In \gls{mtl} each task is equally important. In transfer learning the source task is only used to improve the target task so the target task is more important than the source task \cite{Zhang2017a}. In addition, Transfer Learning uses a linear training timeline. First, the source task is learned and then after learning is completed this knowledge is applied to boost the learning process of the target task. \gls{mtl}, in contrast, is learning both tasks jointly together instead of one after the other.


\subsection{Improvements through Generalization}
\label{sec:03_mtlAdvantages}

There are several reasons why the \gls{mtl} paradigm performs so well. For instance, the generalization error is lower on shared tasks \cite{Caruana1993}. \gls{mtl} acts as a regularization method and encourages the model to accept hypothesis that explain more than one task at the same time \cite{Ruder2017}. The model is forced to develop a representation that fits the data distributions for all tasks. In the end this creates a model that generalizes better because it must attend to different objectives.

\subsection{Improvements through Data Augmentation}

Secondly, Multi-Task Learning increases the number of available data points for training. All tasks share a common representation. While training one task all other tasks are also implicitly trained through the common representation.

\subsubsection*{Statistical Data Amplification}

Each new task also introduces new noise. Traditionally, a model tries to learn by ignoring the noise from its data. However, if the model does not have enough training samples it will overfit because it focuses too much on the noise to explain the data. By introducing additional tasks, new data and therefore new noise is introduced which the model has to try and ignore \cite{Ruder2017}. This aspect is called \textit{Statistical Data Amplification}\cite{Caruana1995a}.

\subsubsection*{Blocking Data Amplification}

\textit{Blocking Data Amplification} occurs when there is little or no noise. Consider the simple example from Caruana \cite{Caruana1995a} that there are two tasks $T$ and $T'$ and common features $F$. The first task $T$ is $T = A \land F $ and the second task $T'$ is $T' = \neg A \land F$. For $A=0$ only $T$ uses feature $F$ and $T'$ does not and for $A=1$ it's the other way around. By training on both tasks $F$ is used no matter what value $A$ takes. 

Rei makes use of these aspects and proposed a sequence labeling framework which uses a secondary, unsupervised word prediction task to augment other tasks such as \gls{ner} or chunking. They show that by including the word prediction the auxiliary task performance is improved for all sequence labeling benchmarks they tried \cite{Rei2017}.

Similarly, Plank et al. show that learning to predict word-frequencies along with \gls{pos}-tagging also improves the total model performance \cite{Plank}. They argue that predicting word frequencies helps to learn the differentiation between rare and common words.


\subsection{Architecture}
The most common architecture for multitask learning is shown in figure \ref{fig:03_mtl_architecture}. It is called hard parameter sharing and consists of at least one layer which is shared among all tasks. In addition, each task has at least one separate layer. This approach is also the one we used for our model which is described in chapter \ref{ch:method}. 

The easiest way to compute the loss for a hard parameter sharing \gls{mtl} architecture is to take the sum of all losses for the individual tasks which is shown in equation ...

\end{figure}



\section{Transfer Learning}
\label{sec:TransferLearning}

In 1991, Pratt et al. suggested to transfer information encoded in a neural network by reusing the network weights in a new network \cite{Pratt1991}. They show that even accounting for the training time of the source network they achieved significant speedups when training a target network compared to random weight initialization.

Yosinski et al. provide a more modern definition: First, a base network is trained on a base dataset. Then, the learned features {(the knowledge)} of the base network is transfered to a second target network which is then trained on the target dataset and task \cite{Yosinski2014}. This process works well if the base and target dataset and tasks are similar.

Goodfellow et al. give a more general definition. They define transfer learning as the transfer of previously learned knowledge from one or multiple sources to a target domain with fewer examples \cite{Goodfellow2016}.

Figure \ref{fig:03_transferLearning} communicates those definitions. 
% TODO: redo figure 
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{figures/03_theory/03_transferLearning}
	\caption{Difference in traditional machine learning were each model uses its own dataset and task. In contrast, in transfer learning a model is first trained on source tasks and part of the features are transformed to the target model to facilitate training. Source: Pan and Yang \cite{Pan2010}}
	\label{fig:03_transferLearning}
\end{figure}

In practice it is very expensive to collect or recollect training data for every new domain. Transfer learning makes it possible to transfer knowledge from a larger dataset to a smaller dataset which greatly reduces the labeling effort \cite{Blitzer2007}. When the target dataset has significantly fewer examples than the base dataset studies showed that it is possible to train large networks without overfitting \cite{Donahue2013}\cite{Zeiler2014}. Usually, after the base model has been trained on the large dataset, the first $n$ layers of the base model are copied over as the first $n$ layers of the target model. The remaining layers of the target model are then randomly initialized and trained. The weights of the $n$ layers from the base model can either be \textit{frozen} or \textit{finetuned} along the rest of the target model. If the target dataset has few samples compared to the number of parameters in the first $n$ layers, finetuning can actually result in overfitting which is a reason why the error during target training is often not backpropagated to the first $n$ layers \cite{Yosinski2014}.

\subsection*{Pre Training}
The most common way to employ transfer learning is pre-training. 
Pre-training is often used in image recognition were interestingly, the first few layers generally form into the same feature regardless of the domain or task \cite{Yosinski2014}. Consequently, researchers are able to exploit this by taking the first layers from a model which was previously trained on a large dataset like ImageNet \cite{Russakovsky2015} and use these weights for their tasks which might have less examples.

This paradigm can also be applied on natural language processing. Understanding what words mean is the fundamental problem every \gls{nlp} model has to solve. Therefore, it is sensible to use an embedding layer which has been pre-trained on large datasets like common crawl which contain petabytes of information \cite{commonCrawl}. This pre-trained embedding layer can then be used in a model trained on a much smaller dataset.
 
\section{Hyperparameter Optimization}

Generally, there are two sets of parameters in machine learning: learned parameters and hyperparameters which are used to configure various aspects of the training process. Learned parameters such as neural network weights are optimized during training whereas hyperparameters are usually defined at the beginning and without a few exceptions {(e.g. learning rate)} do not change during training.

It has been demonstrated that there are a few hyperparameters which have an enormous impact on the overall model performance but identifying those parameters among a big set of possible candidates is difficult \cite{Bergstra2012a}. However, correctly setting these parameters is crucial for achieving a good model performance. Cox and Pinto demonstrated that hyperparameters make the difference between a state of the art model and a model which does not perform better than a random classifier \cite{Cox2011}. Therefore, hyperparamter tuning is critical for the model performance.

Hyperparameters are either hand tuned by reviewing similar literature or by the researchers understanding of the underlying architecutre and how he expects certain parameters to influence the architecture. Another way is to semi automatically optimize or fully automatically optimize the search for good hyperparameters.

This section presents three approaches to optimize the hyperparameter space. The first two are naive, semi-automatic approaches where a set of possible parameters is tried and the success is recorded. The researcher then selects the most promising results. The third example, HyperOpt, is an algorithm which treats the hyperparamter search as an optimization problem and identifies critical parameters and tries to find their optimum value for the given model and task \cite{Bergstra2013}.



\subsection{Grid Search}

Grid search is a very easy method to search for optimal hyperparameters. When performing a grid search for a parameter a new value is sampled from a predefined parameter subset at a fixed interval. Each trial with the new parameter value is then evaluated on the model. For multiple parameters each distinct parameter value is tested against all other parameter values, therefore creating a \textit{grid} of parameter values to test.

This approach is very easy to implement and is trivial to parallelize.

\subsection{Random Search}

Nine trials are performed to optimize a function $f(x, y) = g(x) + h(y) \approx g(x)$. $g(x)$ shown in green has a bigger impact compared to $h(y)$ shown in yellow on the left. Each gray circle represents a trial. Because of the two-dimensional space, grid search can only test $g(x)$ in three places. Random search tries a different $x$ in every trial and is therefore able to find a value close to the optimum. Source: \cite{Bergstra2012a}}

\end{figure}

Surprisingly, Bergstra and Bengio proofed that randomly choosing hyperparameters is more efficient than performing a grid search \cite{Bergstra2012a} for high dimensional search spaces. Instead of defining values in a grid, they randomly sample from the grid space.

The problem with grid search is that by increasing the number of dimensions the number of trials has to increase exponentially to provide the same number of distinct trials for a single parameter \cite{Bergstra2012a}. When performing a grid search on a one-dimensional parameter space, three runs on the model have to be performed in order to test three distinct values of the parameter. Optimizing two parameters {(shown in figure \ref{fig:03_randomSearch})} increases the number of runs to $3^2$ and optimizing $n$ parameters $m$ times will lead to $m^n$ runs. 

Grid search is set up on the assumption that each parameter is equally important. However, it has been shown that not all parameters are equally significant for the model performance \cite{Bergstra2012a}. Figure \ref{fig:03_randomSearch} demonstrates why this is an advantage for random search over grid search. In this specific example one parameter constitutes more towards model performance than the other. However, grid search can only sample three values for the important parameter and is therefore not able to find the optimum value. According to Bergstra and Bengio this situation is the norm rather than the exception for grid search \cite{Bergstra2012a}.

\subsection{HyperOpt}

Hyperopt is an open source\footnote{Official repository \url{https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt}} hyperparameter optimization package by Bergstra et al. \cite{Bergstra2013a}. It treats the hyperparameter search as an optimization problem. Bergstra et al. show that by using \glspl{tpe} and Gaussian processes Hyperopt is able to find hyperparameters that outperform random searches and traditional manual hyperparameter tuning \cite{Bergstra2011}.




\subsubsection*{Challenges}

There are certain challenges when treating hyperparameter tuning as an optimization problem. For instance, the parameter search space is often high dimensional and may contain a mix of continuous {(e.g. learning rate)}, discrete {(e.g. hidden layer size)}, boolean {(e.g. preprocessing steps \cite{Hutter2009})} and even conditional variables \cite{Bergstra2013}. 

For instance the choice of a optimizer or even the machine learning algorithm itself can be seen as a hyperparameter. Each choice then has its own set of parameters which are independent of the other choices. For instance, the Adam optimizer uses certain parameters like $\beta_1$ which the \gls{sgd} optimizer does not use. Hyperopt generates a graph from these conditional parameters and then uses a tree like structure for solving the optimization problem \cite{Bergstra2011}.
\newline

Another difficulty is the limited "fitness evaluation budget" \cite{Bergstra2011}. This means that for each evaluation of a hyperparameter set the model has to be trained which potentially takes a long time. Therefore, Hyperopt has to cope with less evaluation steps than a normal optimization algorithm.

\subsubsection*{Tree of Parzen Estimators {(TPEs)}}
The Hyperopt package uses \glspl{tpe} to sample good hyperparaters from the hyperparameter search space \cite{Bergstra2013a}. To model $p(x|y)$ \gls{tpe} replaces, all distributions in the configuration space by Gaussian mixture equivalents: uniform $\rightarrow$ truncated Gaussian mixture, log-uniform $\rightarrow$ exponentiated trucanted Gaussian mixture and categorical $\rightarrow$ re-weighted categorical \cite{Bergstra2013a}. The prior for the calculation - the different observations $\{x^1,..., x^n, ..., x^k\}$ - is initialized by performing $n$ random runs where the default value for $n$ is 10.

The \gls{tpe} defines $p(x|y)$ as 

\begin{equation}
p(x|y) =
\begin{cases}

l(x) & \text{if } y < y^* \\
g(x) & \text{if } y \geq y^*

\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $l(x)$ {(first case)} is a density formed by an observation $\{x^i\}$ where the loss $y$ of $f(x^i)=y$ was less than a threshold $y^*$. $g(x)$ is the density by using all other remaining observations \cite{Bergstra2013a}. $y^*$ is higher than the best observation so that the density $l(x)$ is formed by more than just one observation. $l(x)$ and $g(x)$ model the hyperparameter search space which means that they have to be hierarchical when the search space contains conditional and discrete variables. $l(x)$ and $g(x)$ are then used to optimize the expected improvement and after each iteration the parameter set with the highest expected improvement is chosen for the next iteration which then becomes the next observation $x^{k+1}$ \cite{Bergstra2013a}. 
























\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Performance Measurements}

\subsubsection*{Precession - Recall}
The most used measure for the precision of food classifiers is the average accuracy which is calculated by dividing the number of correct matches and the total number of samples. Accuracy, however, gives no information about the underlying conditions. It is a measure of overall performance. To have a higher chance of suggesting the correct items, future systems may present a list of options that the user can chose from. Intuitively, the accuracy is much higher if a classifier can present a list of items with high confidences instead of only one item because the problem is much easier. Accuracy, however, does not measures how easy a problem is. If a classifier were able to suggest all classes as options the accuracy would always be 100\% although the results are not useful at all.

The combination of precision and recall objectively measures the actual relevance and performance of a classifier for a class of images because it includes the amount of considered items and the correct predictions. In this case the amount of considered items changes based on how many items the classifier can suggest. Precision and recall is defined as:

\begin{equation}
Precision = \frac{T_p}{T_p+F_p} \quad Recall = \frac{T_p}{T_p+F_n}.
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item True positives $T_P$ is the number of correctly classified images of a class.
	\item False positives $F_P$ are all images that the classifier predicted to be positive but are in reality negative. {(Type I Error)}
	\item False negatives $F_N$ are all images that are positive {(belong to the class)} but are labeled as negative {(do not belong to class)} {(Type II Error)}
\end{itemize}

A high recall means that many images were matched correctly and a high precision denotes a low number of incorrectly classified images. The bigger the area under the Precision-Recall curve the better the classifier.

\subsubsection*{Null Error Rate}
The null error rate is a baseline for any classification task that calculates the accuracy if a classifier would just predict the class with the most images.

\subsubsection*{Confusion Matrix}
Confusion matrices are one of the most important metrics to understand why a classifier struggles with certain classes while getting a high precision with others. As the name suggests, a confusion matrix tells if the classifier "confuses" two classes.

A confusion matrix for $n$ classes is always a $n \times n$ matrix where columns represent the actual images classes and rows represent the predicted image classes so if the diagonal of the matrix has high values this means that the classifier makes correct predictions.

\subsubsection*{Categorical Cross-Entropy}
The categorical cross-entropy $L_i$ is an error function that is used for the training of neural networks in classification tasks as the objective function. It is more versatile than the accuracy or the \gls{mse} because it takes the deviations of the predicted label $p_{i,j}$ and the actual label $t_{i,j}$ into account and weights the "closeness" of the prediction with the logarithm. For classification, cross entropy is more useful than \gls{mse} because \gls{mse} gives too much emphasis on incorrect predictions. The categorical cross entropy function is defined as:

\begin{equation}
L_i = - \sum_{j} t_{i,j}\log(p_{i,j})
\end{equation} 

The loss values that are used for the discussion of results for neural networks are the average values of the categorical cross-entropy {(\gls{ace})}.

\subsection{Cross Validation}
Cross validation is one of the most essential techniques to evaluate real-world classification performance. Classifiers like \glspl{svm} or neural networks are always better on data they have already seen. This is called overfitting {(see section \ref{subsec:overfittingDropout})}. By training and testing on the same data the classification performance would be much better than the actual real world performance. To test if a classifier can actually work with samples it has not seen cross validation divides the dataset into different partitions. 

For most tasks it is sufficient to divide the dataset into a training and a test set. The data in the training set is used to train the classifier and the test data is used to evaluate it with data is has not seen before.

\subsubsection*{k-fold Cross Validation}
To make the classification evaluation even more robust, $k$-fold cross validation is used. By applying $k$-fold cross validation the dataset is randomly partitioned into $k$ different parts. $k-2$ parts are used for training and two parts are used for the evaluation. This process is repeated $k$-times and after each iteration the parts are exchanged so that at the end, each sample was used for training and for validation. Calculating the mean of the $k$ evaluations gives a much more robust measurement because the evaluation does not depend on the difficulty of the test partitions.
